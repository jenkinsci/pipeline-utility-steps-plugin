<p>
    Reads a file in the current working directory or a String as a plain text
    <a href="http://www.json.org/json-it.html" target="_blank">JSON</a> file.
    The returned object is a normal Map with String keys or a List of primitives or Map.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>WARNING:</strong><br/>
    Using the <code>readJSON</code> function with a <code>text</code> argument will log the text
    of the JSON into the Pipeline flow log.

    <code><pre>
readJSON text: "{ 'password': 'value' }"
    </pre></code>

    You can avoid this by writing to a temporary file, however that brings its own risks that
    should be considered based on your requirements.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code><pre>
def props = readJSON file: 'dir/input.json'
assert props['attr1'] == 'One'
assert props.attr1 == 'One'

def props = readJSON text: '{ "key": "value" }'
assert props['key'] == 'value'
assert props.key == 'value'

def props = readJSON text: '[ "a", "b"]'
assert props[0] == 'a'
assert props[1] == 'b'

def props = readJSON text: '{ "key": null, "a": "b" }', returnPojo: true
assert props['key'] == null
props.each { key, value ->
    echo "Walked through key $key and value $value"
}
    </pre></code>
