    Writes a
    <a href="https://maven.apache.org/pom.html" target="_blank">Maven project</a>
    file. That for example was previously read by <code>readMavenPom</code>.
</p>
<strong>Fields:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>model</code>:
        The <a href="http://maven.apache.org/components/ref/3.3.9/maven-model/apidocs/org/apache/maven/model/Model.html">Model</a>
        object to write.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>file</code>:
        Optional path to a file in the workspace to write to.
        <em>If left empty the step will write to <code>pom.xml</code> in the current working directory.</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        <pre>
        def pom = readMavenPom file: 'pom.xml'
        //Do some manipulation
        writeMavenPom model: pom
        </pre>
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    Avoid using this step and <code>readMavenPom</code>.
    It is better to use the <code>sh</code> step to run <code>mvn</code> goals:
    <a href="https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/set-property-mojo.html">versions:set-property</a>, for example.
