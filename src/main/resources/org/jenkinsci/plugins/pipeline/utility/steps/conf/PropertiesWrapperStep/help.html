<p>
    Reads a file in the current working directory or a String as a plain text
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html" target="_blank">Java Properties</a>
    file, and then sets those properties as environment variables for the block.
    The properties can also be pre loaded with default values before reading/parsing the data.
</p>
<strong>Fields:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>file</code>:
        Optional path to a file in the workspace to read the properties from.
        <em>These are added to the resulting map after the defaults and so will overwrite any key/value pairs already present.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>text</code>:
        An Optional String containing properties formatted data.
        <em>These are added to the resulting map after <code>file</code> and so will overwrite any key/value pairs already present.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>defaults</code>:
        An Optional Map containing default key/values.
        <em>These are added to the resulting map first.</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        <pre>
        def d = [test: 'Default', something: 'Default', other: 'Default']
        propertiesWrapper(defaults: d, file: 'dir/my.properties', text: 'other=Override') {
          assert test == 'One'
          assert something == 'Default'
          assert env.something == 'Default'
          assert env.other == 'Override'
        }
        </pre>
    </code>
